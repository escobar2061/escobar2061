# Hi! 👋🏽
Thank you for taking the time to check out my Github! 

- 📌 Take a look at the highlighted repositories I've pinned, showcasing my favorite projects. While many of these stemmed from my coursework at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I earned my Master's in Environmental Data Science, each demonstrates the practical application of the skills and knowledge I've acquired throughout my academic journey. 

- 📚 You can see visuals and completed projects over on my [website](https://romero61.github.io/projects.html) that I built using Quarto.

-  I'm passionate about the intersection of machine learning  💻, remote sensing 🛰, and environmental problems 🌏.
