# Hi! 👋🏽
Thank you for taking the time to check out my Github! 

- 📌 Take a look at the highlighted repositories I've pinned, showcasing my favorite projects. While many of these stemmed from my coursework at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management – University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I earned my Master's in Environmental Data Science, each demonstrates the practical application of the skills and knowledge I've acquired throughout my academic journey.
